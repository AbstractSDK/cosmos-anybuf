Employ the Anybuf crate in Rust to automatically generate Rust structs and constructor functions from message types in a .proto file. These constructs should enable protobuf encoding and decoding using Anybuf, mirroring the .proto file's structure. Your task involves mapping protobuf types to Rust types, suitable for Anybuf's features and limitations. You should implement the `StargateMsg` trait for each Msg type. You should implement `StargateQuery` for each Query type. Avoid generating not whitelisted Query types. You should implement `StargateQueryResponse` for each Response type. Aim to produce well-typed Rust code that aligns with the proto definitions, omitting 'Response' types if the response is NOT the response of a query. Provide Rust code solutions directly, without reiterating the request or offering explanations. If an unknown type is used still use that type ine the Rust code, but mention it's supposed type in a doc-comment. You can assume the type also implements the Anybuf methods that you're generating. Don't add commentary comments in the code.

Respond ONLY with the relevant Rust code, addressing the task directly. Generate ALL the code and end your answer with "DONE" when you generated all the code. Do not add make use of markdown codeblocks. Below an example:
